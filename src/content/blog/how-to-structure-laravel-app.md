# Introduction

In this blog post, I will try to talk about how can you structure a server-side application in a simple way, while using a clean and efficient architecture that could be used for small to large applications.

This will be a "theoretic" article, I won't show code, and it won't be tied to a specific language, it's going to be an approach based on the design/architecture of the application, this way you can apply it to any language that you may know.


## The normal way - MVC

I think you already heard about the MVC pattern, it's a widespread way to structure a server-side application, but it's not the best way to do it, because it's not very efficient and it's not very maintainable.

In this architecture, we have three different layers where the access to the data (Database) is on the Data Layer, that's accessed by the Communication Layer that's the layer responsible for receiving the requests from the Visual Layer where the user interacts with the software, doing the needed processing and returning the response back to the Visual Layer.

This is a simple and practical architecture. However, with the advance of the software that started to grow in complexity, this architecture started to be obsolete because of the coupling of the code and the layers starting to have a lot of responsibilities.
